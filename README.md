### Variables

This collection uses the following variables to make it easy to chain requests together:
- `baseUrl`
- `secretKey`
- `connectionToken`
- `vehicleId`
- `driverId`
- `syncId`

> **Note:** You can set these variables in your environment or collection. Some will be set automatically for you based on the response of previous requests.

### Connection Tokens

Terminal uses connection tokens to authenticate requests targeting a specific connection. Please set a `connectionToken` variable in your environment variables if you'd like to act on a specific connection. You can retrieve connection tokens in the dashboard or by calling `GET /connections`.

> **Note:** When calling `POST /public-token/exchange` the connection token is set automatically for you upon successful exchange.
